<h2>Dodge the stars</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Most games use arrow keys to control charaters in "bullet-hell" genre games, I have made it the mouse making it more difficult
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The mouse controls and acceleration on the character
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned some basic javascript and the usefulness of phaser examples
The hardest part about making this was finding the bugs.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The default logo moving thing</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use your mouse to move the logo to avoid the stars
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Fun avoiding the stars.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the mouse to move the logo
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Mostly reseting the logo to the center to open the option to move to either side.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone can play this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 2-5 minutes
</li>

</ul>
